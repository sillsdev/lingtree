# lingtree
LingTree is a tool to produce linguistic tree diagrams. 

The user keys in a description of the tree, processes that description, and LingTree shows what the tree looks like. The tree can be saved in a number of different file formats so that it can be included in papers or web pages.

This is a JavaFX 8 project.
